# HypervisorControl

A tool to quickly disable or enable the hypervisor, created by aneeskhan47.

I developed this tool to address a specific challenge I faced. While playing the game Valorant, its Vanguard anti-cheat system requires that either the TPM 2.0 module be present or that the hypervisor be disabled. However, for my work, I frequently use WSL2, which requires the hypervisor to be enabled. This tool allows users to seamlessly switch between having the hypervisor enabled or disabled, followed by a system restart, ensuring compatibility both for valorant and work purposes.

I hope that works for you! Let me know if you'd like any further modifications.
